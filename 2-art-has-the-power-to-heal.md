## Instructions

1. **Personal Reflection - Maya Lin.  (200 words minimum)** 

```
“How does learning about the objections met by Maya Lin and hearing the artist speak about her challenges change your understanding and appreciation of her work?”
```


2. **Formal Analysis Paper - Public ART in the Austin Community College District. (1000 words minimum)**

```
Find a large scale outdoor public sculpture, IN THE AREA WHERE YOU LIVE, during the window of this assignment. Visit it and spend some time with it observing and making notes. Take a selfie with the selected piece in the background. Photos are required and must embedded or inserted into the body of your submission. Careful to not exceed maximum file size ( optimizing images ). Please do NOT submit images as an attachment. Write a formal analysis of the selected work, using the form below.
```

**This is the form of your paper, submitted in a single document.**

**Part 1 Personal Reflection** - Maya Lin. Single paragraph.

**Part 2 Formal Analysis Paper** - Public ART in the Austin Community College District. 

```
Using the form below, do your own writing. Your instructor is looking for an authentic and well-organized writing sample. Do not quote other authors. Use your own voice, as you write to produce a college-level writing sample.
```

**A. Introduction paragraph:**

```
Create a complete heading for your paper. Introduce the selected artwork by title, artist, date, medium, scale, and location. If the artist is unknown, DO NOT use the work. Find another. Include a detailed description of the piece, describing the work as if the reader has not seen it. Make note important features. Be certain to include a thesis statement in which three visual elements are identified because they contribute to the work's overall successfulness, both in terms of expression and content. How did you and people in the community interact with it? SPECIAL Note: Write about the artwork, not the artist. Use double-spaced line spacing, 12 point font. ( 200 words minimum )
```

**B. The body of your paper must contain three separate paragraphs.**

```
In separate paragraphs, discuss three different Visual Elements and related Principles of Design seen. The body of the paper will consist of a careful analysis of each of the three visual elements deemed most relevant in the work.  Observe and explain how the visual element is working in the overall composition and the supporting design principle is seen in the composition. Relate the ways these pictorial properties convey content or meaning to the viewer. (minimum 600 words) 
```
1. **1st paragraph:** Visual element and supporting principle of design.
2. **2nd paragraph:** Visual element and supporting principle of design.
3. **3rd paragraph:** Visual element and supporting principle of design.

***The Visual Elements***

```
Describe the characteristics of the visible properties such as color or line or shape that make up the work’s aesthetic form. (Chapter 4)
```

***The Principles of Design***

```
Reflect the ways in which the Visual Elements are assembled into a coherent whole. (Chapter 5)
```

**C. Conclusion paragraph.**

```
In the conclusion, students should summarize how the three visual elements work together with companion design principles to express or convey meaning ( what is the artist trying to say or express ) for communication and expression. ( 200 words minimum )
```

*Note: While it is worth a visit, please do not use Vince Hannemann's The Cathedral of Junk or Art Walls on Castle Hill in Austin or any architecture. I find these difficult to write about in terms of the requirements of the assignment.*

**Ready to submit a final draft for grading?**

*Browse and upload your paper. Browse and locate your image files, upload these too. Check the box ( ... I agree) and run Safe Assign. Allow plenty of time for this process. If you get a Safe Assign match of greater than 10%, you will need to revise your paper before submitting the final copy. Be authentic! Follow my instructions and use your own words as you write and don't quote others. Warning: If evidence of plagiarism is found, your paper may not be accepted and a grade of zero will be posted.*
