# Notes
- Maya Lin was enrolled at stanford in an architecture class when she submitted her design
- The contest was anonymous, people were only given a number
- The question remains, if people had known she was female young, had no credentials and asian american, would they have chosen her submission
- When news got out who the winner of the contest was, there was outrage
- There was even a funding for a more traditional style memorial form the opposition that was erected that depicts a classical bronze design
- The memorial itself is made of large polished black granite slabs that grow in height as you near the vertex of the memorial
- The only thing engraved on the memorial itself are the names, void of any rank, accomplishments, just names and dates
- The black granite is highly reflective, and looks like space black the only things with substance are the names themselves, they stand out very clearly.
- The amazing part of the simplicity, is that it disconnects you from each person's life, the only thing represented on the monument is a name and the day they died, no man is more important than another, no man is less important than another.
